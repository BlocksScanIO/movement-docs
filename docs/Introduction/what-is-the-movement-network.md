# What is the Movement Network?

Movement Labs is building a network of Move-based blockchains. Our flagship products are the Movement Network and the M1 shared sequencer. 

Movement is a community-first blockchain providing the highest possible TPS through Move, instant finality, native day-zero access to mass liquidity, and modular customizations.

It will support Aptos Move, Sui Move, and also our embedded EVM interpreter MEVMâ€”empowering both Sui, Aptos, and EVM users to use the L2.
